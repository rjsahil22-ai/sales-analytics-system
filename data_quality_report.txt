2) INVALID RECORDS REMOVED (Reason-wise)
---------------------------------------
Rules applied to remove invalid records:

2. Quantity <= 0                 -> Removed
3. UnitPrice <= 0                -> Removed

5. Missing/extra fields          -> Removed

Expected invalid records: ~10

---------------------------------------------
The following transformations were applied and valid records were kept:

- ProductName cleaning:
  Removed commas inside product names
  Example: "Mouse,Wireless" -> "MouseWireless"

- Numeric value cleaning:
  Removed commas from numeric fields before conversion
  Example: "1,916" -> 1916

- Empty lines handling:
  Empty lines were skipped safely

- Data type conversion:
  Quantity -> int
  UnitPrice -> float
